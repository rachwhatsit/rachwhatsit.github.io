I am a second year statistics student studying causal algebras under the supervision of [Jim Q. Smith](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/smith/). I am a part of the [Leverhulme Bridges](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/bridges/) programme that aims to bridge the gap between the mathematical and social sciences. My work is motivated by a long-held conviction that mathematical models should be attuned to the realities faced by practitioners outside the academy. I hope to further demonstrate how causal algebras can be customized to pertinent domain expertise.

Previously, I worked at the intersection of public data systems and academic research as a data scientist for Baylor University's Texas Hunger Initiative. A staunch open data advocate, I aim to bridge the gap between data-driven models and the complex socioeconomic challenges facing communities, particularly with regard to food insecurity. A West Texas native and Baylor Mathematics alumna, I hold a M.Sc. in Complexity Science from the University of Warwick where I studied the mathematics of real world systems. I learned to love math cleaning spectroscopy data at the [McDonald Observatory](https://www.instagram.com/mcdonald_observatory/), modeling epidemic dynamics using mobile phone data from Iceland, and traveling to [Budapest](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/) to learn graph theory.
