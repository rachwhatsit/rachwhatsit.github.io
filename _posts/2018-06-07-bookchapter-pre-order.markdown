Together with [Kathy Krey](https://www.baylor.edu/texashunger/index.php?id=929014) and [Linda English](https://business.baylor.edu/directory/?id=Linda_English), I had the chance to contribute a chapter on the "Complex Challenges to Participation in Federal Nutrition Programs" to the book *Food and Poverty: Food Insecurity and Food Sovereignty among America's Poor*. 

The book is [available on Amazon here!](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Poverty-Insecurity-Sovereignty-Americas/dp/0826522041/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527097312&sr=8-1&keywords=food+and+poverty+food+insecurity+and+food+sovereignty&dpID=416U49CUsnL&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
