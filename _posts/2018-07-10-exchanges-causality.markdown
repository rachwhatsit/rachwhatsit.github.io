Last October, the [Leverhulme Bridges](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/bridges/) hosted a conference on interdisciplinary perspectives on causality. Inspired by the exchange between the quantitative and qualititave sciences, [Martine Barons](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/barons/) and I wrote up the conference for Warwick Exchanges. Check it out [here](https://exchanges.warwick.ac.uk/article/view/238/327)!
