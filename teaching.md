### Economics 
 
#### ECO4V98/5V98: Data Analytics
Spring 2014, Fall 2014

Course description: Technological advances in the last few years have contributed to a rapid rise in the availability of data. Electronic data capture has become ubiquitous and large data sets may be gathered from: e-commerce records, government web server logs, tweet streams, online transaction records, government records, point-of-sale devices, and bar-code readers. This abundance of data can be analyzed for a variety of applications, including fraud detection, customer relationship management, and stock market investments.

The general aim of this course is to build intuition around data analysis so that you do not panic when you meet data in the wild. To wrangle said data, we will turn to interdisciplinary methods from fields including mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and computer science. A useful takeaway from the course will be the ability to perform exploratory data analysis and implement basic predictive methods in the statistical programming software, R.
